function App() {
  return (
    <div>
      <Card>
        <h1>Hello, World!</h1>
        <Button onClick={() => alert('Button clicked!')}>Click Me</Button>
      </Card>
    </div>
  );
}

export default App;
```

## Components

### Button

A customizable button component.

**Props:**

- `onClick` (function): Function to call when the button is clicked.
- `children` (node): Content to display inside the button.
- `variant` (string): Style variant of the button (e.g., 'primary', 'secondary').

```jsx
import { Button } from 'react-component-library';
